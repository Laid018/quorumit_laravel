# Requirements 
* Port **80** and **3006** free. That is, you cannot have another webserver up at the time of initializing the installation. (If necessary, it can be changed in ``docker-compose.yml`` to the desired port mapping).
* Download any docker from the previous version installed with ``docker compose down``, inside the project folder.

# Docker installation 
1. Docker Desktop
    * [Instalaci贸n Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
    * [Instalaci贸n Fedora](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/fedora/)
    * [Instalaci贸n Docker Desktop Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/)
2. Docker Compose
    * [Instalaci贸n General](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

git clone git@github.com:Laid018/quorumite_laravel.git
cd quorumite_laravel
```
```bash
composer install
```

# Use with docker
Enter the terminal and run ``docker-compose up -d --build``, to run the application with docker.

```

In case of connection failure, re-execute command ``docker-compose up -d --build``

Run Laravel migrations:
```bash
docker exec -it app php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```
Run npm install:
```bash
docker exec -it app npm install
```
Run npm run build:
```bash
docker exec -it app npm run build
```
Run npm run dev:
```bash
docker exec -it app npm run dev
```

It is only necessary to enter the project folder and run ``docker compose up -d`` to raise the services. And the services are downloaded with ``docker compose down``.

# Use locally
Enter the terminal and execute the following commands to run the application without problems.
```bash 
composer install
```
```bash
npm install
```

For the database you must create the database in mysql.

Once the database is created, run the migrations
``php artisan migrate --seed``

To run the app run
```bash 
php artisan serve
```
```bash
npm run dev
```
